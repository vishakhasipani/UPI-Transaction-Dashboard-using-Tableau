Project Title: UPI Transaction Analysis using Tableau

In this project, I used Tableau to visualize and analyze UPI transaction data to understand digital payment trends in India. The dashboard displayed key insights such as transaction volume, transaction value, monthly growth trends, and platform-wise performance (e.g., PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm). Interactive visuals and filters allowed for a deeper dive into regional usage and user behavior. The project highlighted the growing impact of UPI in India's digital economy.
